# Evencio Trademark Policy

Evencio Marketing Tools is open source under the MIT License, but the **Evencio** name, logo, and related brand assets are **trademarks** of Evencio and are **not** licensed for use without permission. Evencio is the property of Yan Malinovskiy.

## Why This Matters
Trademark rules prevent confusion in the market. They protect users from mistaking a third-party fork or service for the official Evencio experience.

## What Is Covered
- The **Evencio** name and wordmark
- The Evencio logo and logo variations
- Brand assets, including official iconography and lockups

## What Is Allowed (Without Permission)
- **Truthful, descriptive references** (e.g., “compatible with Evencio Marketing Tools”)
- **Source attribution** (e.g., “forked from Evencio Marketing Tools”) without implying endorsement

## What Is Not Allowed (Without Permission)
- Using the Evencio name, logo, or brand assets in product names, domains, or marketing
- Presenting a fork or service in a way that implies official Evencio sponsorship or endorsement
- Rebranding your service as “Evencio” or “Evencio Marketing Tools”

## How to Request Permission
If you want to use Evencio trademarks or brand assets, contact Yan Malinovskiy at yanmalinovskiy@evenc.io and describe the intended use.

## Notes
- This policy **does not** change the MIT License for the code.
- Trademark permission is separate from code usage rights.
